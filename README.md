# Hand Gesture-based Volume and Brightness Control using OpenCV and MediaPipe

Features:
- Hand Gesture Recognition: The system uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hand gestures in real-time. It analyzes hand movements and recognizes predefined gestures to trigger volume and brightness adjustments.
- Volume Control: By performing specific hand gestures, users can increase or decrease the volume of their devices without touching any physical controls.
- Brightness Control: Hand gestures are mapped to adjust the brightness of the screen, allowing users to conveniently change the display brightness levels.
- Real-time Feedback: The system provides visual feedback by overlaying graphical indicators on the screen, confirming the recognized hand gestures and the resulting volume or brightness changes.
- Flexibility and Customization: The project offers the flexibility to define and customize hand gestures for different actions or even extend it to support additional functionalities.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
3. Run the main script: python volBrtnessControl.py
4. Position your hand in front of the camera and perform the predefined gestures to control volume and brightness.
5. Observe the real-time feedback and enjoy the hands-free control experience.
